    "- DB Bank is a large public sector bank that has branches across the cities. It provides various services like savings accounts, current accounts, term deposits, personal loans, home loans, etc. to customers. Whenever the bank conducts marketing on its new schemes, it will keep track of data related to customersâ€™ personal, social, and economic details. Also, it maintains the detailing of efforts made to achieve success in the campaign. Recently, the bank has conducted a campaign to market its term-deposit scheme. Campaigns were conducted based mostly on direct phone calls, soliciting the bank's customers to place  a term deposit. After all the marketing efforts, if the client had agreed to place a deposit, then the campaign is a success, otherwise not (Target variable marked 'yes', or 'no')."
